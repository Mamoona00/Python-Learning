* Python Language Introduction
Python is poular high level programming language.It was creatted  Guido Van Rossum in 1991.It is dynamically typed general purpose language.
Python is mostly used language beacause it is:
Simple and easy to use.
Free and open source.
Platform independant.
Code written in other programming languages can ported to python with some effortsand also code of python can also used in other programming languages.
Tnterpreter of python executes code line by line.
Today as far as development is concerened It is used everywhere e. scientific applications, web and game development, Artificial Intelligence and datbase development.

* Python 3 basics
Here are some basics od python 3:
Variables can created by assigning a value to a name. e.g x = 3.
Python 3 supports several buil in datatypes fo example string, tuples, lists, int, float, dictionaries etc.
There is variety of operators in Python 3 like arithmetic, comparison and logicall operators.
Functions in python 3 can created by using def keyword.
input() is used to get input
print() is used to display output.

* Difference btw python 2.x and python 3.x
There is difference of print statement. In python 2 it is used without parentheses and in python 3 it is used with parenthese and double quotes.
Syntax of python 2 is complicated whereas syntax of python 3 is easier to understand.
code written in python 2 can ported to python 3 with some efforts but python 3 is not backward compatible.
Another difference is of range function. in python 2 xrange() is used for itrations but in python 3 Range() is introduced for iterations.

* Keywords
Keyword are the reserved words whose meaning is already defined.
Keyword cannot be used as name of variable, name of function and identifier.
Python keyword are case sensitive. All keyword are written in lowercase except True and False.
Different versions of python have different number of keywords.some have 33 and some have 35. I have Python 3.12.0 and it has 25 keywords.

*Namespace and scope:
Namespace is a name for objects in python. Objects acn be function or variables.Surname is example of namespace. For exampple a class have 2 students that have same name haider but their surname is different. So the surname differs between these two students.
In python namespace differs between name of objects and methods.
Types of namespace:
built in (always present)
global (user create)
local
lifetime of namespace depends upon scope of object.
scope refers to the coding region that defines accesibility of object.

*statement, indentation and comments:
Statemets are the instructions written in source code for execution.
sinle line statements
statements written in only one line. assignment, break, del, return
multi line statements
statments that extendes to one or more lines. loop and conditional statements(if else, for, while)
in other programming languages we use curly braces to define block of code but in python whitespace can be used for indentation.It's the unique features of the Python Language.
Comments in python start with hash symbol. comments make code more understandable. comment are ignored by python interpreter.
single line comment: can be written with hash symbol.
multiline comment: can be written within 3 double or single qoutes.
